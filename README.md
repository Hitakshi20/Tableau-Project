This repository contains Tableau dashboard, visualization, and data analysis project I have created.

### Overview -
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using Tableau, built on the British Airways reviews dataset. The goal is to analyze customer feedback, identify trends, and visualize key insights that can provide actionable intelligence for enhancing customer experience.

### Project Description -
This interactive Tableau dashboard was created to analyze customer feedback for British Airways, focusing on service-related metrics. The main objectives of this project are to:

- Provide a clear overview of customer satisfaction across key areas such as cabin staff service, entertainment, food, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money.

- Visualize trends in cabin staff service over time, by country, and across various aircraft types.
  
- Offer insights to help British Airways improve service based on customer reviews.

### Key Visualizations - 
- Top Metrics: Displays average ratings for overall service categories, including cabin staff service, entertainment, food, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money.
  
- Average Cabin Staff Service by Month: Line graph showing monthly trends in cabin staff service ratings from 2016 to 2023.
  
- Average Cabin Staff Service by Country: A world map visual highlighting cabin staff service ratings by customer nationality, providing a geographical breakdown of satisfaction.
  
- Average Cabin Staff Service by Aircraft: A bar chart comparing the average cabin staff service ratings across different aircraft models, along with the number of reviews for each aircraft.
